<p>It's commonly said that "Past performance is no guarantee of future results" and that is absolutely true. Investments with higher potential for return (like stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.) come with higher risk; sometimes their values will go up and sometimes they will go down. Our questions assumed a guaranteed rate of return, but with real-life investments there is no guarantee. When investing your own money, choose a risk level that is comfortable for you, and only invest money that you can comfortably see decrease in the short and long-term.</p>
